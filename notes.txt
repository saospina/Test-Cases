    doesn't return to home when I apply the sensor
    must return to the home after 20 sg always?
    multiple locker issues to do pickup- not ready ok but the app isn't painting the comparments
    --we can do pickup when the order has an item with status verify, 
    but after the system do dispense at the item and don't open the doorand 
    isn't possible  to know what is item that stay in dispense with a loop--

    change to reclaim without open the door. (item that was in lockdown)

    warning 
    not show that items are in a status different to pending and ready

    I have some doubts about the correct flow of  Pickup process
    what is the correct flow when I take the order from locker compartment without to do  a Clientcode, Reclaimcode or verify?

    from the back it should reclaim
    for frictionless
    from the front you need the client code to open the door
    if locker has no front door, it should flash red

    Yessica Gomez [1:50 PM]
    and the status of the item must be the same (should not change )

    Dave [1:50 PM]
    for the flash red?
    yes


    Yessica Gomez [1:55 PM]
    ok, then there is an an issue with this flow in Gandalf; let me do a complete flow with this and I will send you the steps for you replicate it

    Dave [1:59 PM]
    ok
